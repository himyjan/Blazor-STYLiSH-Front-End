# Samples to accompany the official Microsoft Blazor documentation

Samples in this repository accompany the [official Microsoft Blazor documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/blazor/).

To obtain a local copy of the sample apps in this repository, use ***either*** of the following approaches:

* [Fork this repository](https://docs.github.com/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) and [clone it](https://docs.github.com/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) to your local system.
* Select the **Code** button. Select **Download ZIP** to save the repository locally. Extract the saved Zip archive (`.zip`) to access the sample apps.

## Snippet sample apps for article code examples

**WARNING**: Always follow an article's security guidance when implementing sample code.

Prior to the release of .NET 8, snippet sample apps for Blazor Server and Blazor WebAssembly provide the code examples that appear in Blazor articles. Many of the components in the snippet sample apps compile and run if copied to a local test app. However, the entire snippet sample apps aren't meant to be runnable demonstration sample apps, and not all of the components are completely functional. The purpose of the snippet sample apps prior to .NET 8's release is merely to supply code examples to documentation.

For the release of .NET 8 (and later releases), the sample apps for Blazor Web App and Blazor WebAssembly both supply snippets to articles and are fully working demonstration sample apps. All of the components in these apps function normally.

Blazor snippet sample apps

* Blazor Web App (.NET 8 or later)
* Blazor Server (.NET 7.0 or earlier)
* Blazor WebAssembly

# Using Tailwind CSS v3.2 with Blazor (.Net 6 or above)

This method works for Blazor Server and Blazor WebAssembly with hot reload, style isolation and tailwind jit compilation.

## Setup with using Standalone Tailwind CSS CLI without Node.js

For this method you need added to path [Tailwind CSS CLI](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/releases/latest) binary. Read more about [Standalone CLI](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/standalone-cli).

Just create a `StaticAssets` folder in the root of your project with next structure.

```txt
StaticAssets
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄstyles.css
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄtailwind.config.js
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄTailwindCli.targets
```

Import `TailwindCli.targets` into your `.csproj` file.

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web">

  ...

  <Import Project="StaticAssets\TailwindCli.targets" />

</Project>
```

Change your `Pages/_Layout.cshtml` file if you are using Blazor Server  
or `wwwroot/index.html` file if you are using Blazor WebAssembly.  
Add css link

```html
<link href="css/styles.css" rel="stylesheet" />
```

Run this command in the terminal (change `{ProjectDirectory}` to project directory). Actualy you can see the text of this command after calling `dotnet build`, `dotnet run` or `dotnet watch`.

```shell
cd {ProjectDirectory}/StaticAssets/ && tailwindcss -i styles.css -o {ProjectDirectory}/wwwroot/css/styles.css -w
```

If you are using github workflows with your project then you need to add additional step.

```yml

---
- name: Setup Tailwind CSS
  run: |
    curl -sLO https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/releases/latest/download/tailwindcss-linux-x64
    chmod +x tailwindcss-linux-x64
    sudo mv tailwindcss-linux-x64 /usr/bin/tailwindcss
```

## Setup with using Node.js and npm

Just create a `StaticAssets` folder in the root of your project with next structure.

```txt
StaticAssets
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄpackage.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄstyles.css
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄtailwind.config.js
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄTailwindNpm.targets
```

Import `TailwindNpm.targets` into your `.csproj` file.

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web">

  ...

  <Import Project="StaticAssets\TailwindNpm.targets" />

</Project>
```

Change your `Pages/_Layout.cshtml` file if you are using Blazor Server  
or `wwwroot/index.html` file if you are using Blazor WebAssembly.  
Add css link

```html
<link href="css/styles.css" rel="stylesheet" />
```

Run this command in the terminal (change `{ProjectDirectory}` to project directory). Actualy you can see the text of this command after calling `dotnet build`, `dotnet run` or `dotnet watch`.

```shell
cd {ProjectDirectory}/StaticAssets/ && npx --no-install tailwindcss -i styles.css -o {ProjectDirectory}/wwwroot/css/styles.css -w
```
